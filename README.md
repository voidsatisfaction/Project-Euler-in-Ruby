# Project Euler in Ruby
Sharing my own solutions of Project Euler problems.

## Account
- Korean : 텅 빈 충만
- English : voidSatisfaction

## Number of solved problems (2017. 1. 11)
- Korean : 110(Ruby)
- Enlgish : 57(Scheme)

## Language
- Ruby
- Scheme
- JavaScript

## Notice
My coding style and algorithm skills are getting better comparing to initial state. Therefore I recommend you to refer newest codes rather than outdated one.

To illustrate the way of solving, I used **Korean** as I worked mainly on Korean Project Euler site.

But since Korean site only has problems until 120(2016. 9. 19.), after 120, I will use english to explain the idea of the problem solving.

Also, I heartfully welcome all kinds of feedbacks and contacts from you guys.

혹시 풀이에 대한 피드백이나 궁금한 점이 있으시면,

친하게 지내고 싶으신 분 누구든 아래의 연락처로 연락주세요 ~ 환영합니다 ^^
